I felt that for this project I had to redo the majority of the code so I could use css and flexbox in order to accomidate different screen sizes/resolutions. However, it was really nice using chatGPT for a lot of the work since it was mostly arranding everything I had already created in project 2. I still found myself making small adjustments and edits whether it was the text placements or image size, but overall I struggled less than in some of the specifics of octopus arranment during project 3. I also saw just how much more straight forward webpage code can be when you can use more than just raw HTML, as transforming this website made me see what a difference CSS can make when trying to achieve the same thing.
